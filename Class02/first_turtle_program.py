## Need these things in order to use turtles:

from turtle import *

colormode(255) # This makes it easier to manipulate colors

# This is our turtle, stored in a variable named leo
leo = Turtle()

leo.speed(1) # slows down leo so we can see what's happening
leo.width(3) # Increases the pen's width to 3 pixels wide

# This tells leo to move forward 80 pixels
leo.forward(80)
leo.left(60)
leo.forward(110)

leo.right(150)
leo.forward(200)
leo.left(60)
leo.backward(300)


# shirley = Turtle()
# 
# shirley.right(90)
# shirley.forward(200)
